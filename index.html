    <h1>Getting to know Thien</h1>  
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hello, My name is Thien. I'm from Vietnam. I am a transfer student, so this is my first year at Lesley. My major is UX design. My passion is music. I have an entire vinyl collection for that. I also enjoy building things with Blender and coding. Coding is a lot of fun. I selected design school mostly because everything is designed, and I aspire to be some type of God (just joking). I was interested in design because I wanted to learn about the ideas that foundation it, such as colors, compositions, grid systems, etc.</p>
